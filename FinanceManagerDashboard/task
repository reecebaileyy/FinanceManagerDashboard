Finance Manager Dashboard Task Backlog
===================================

Foundation & Architecture
- [x] Confirm final architecture approach (Next.js App Router frontend + dedicated Node.js microservices + PostgreSQL) and document service boundaries/APIs based on the proposal. (note: docs/architecture.md captures decisions and service contracts referencing CS490 Starter 26.pdf)
- [x] Finalize technology choices: component library/theming strategy, charting library, auth provider, background job runner, email/SMS providers, LLM vendor for AI assistant, bank-link integration (e.g., Plaid), infrastructure stack (AWS EC2/RDS/S3). (note: docs/tech-stack.md records finalized component, integration, and platform selections.)
- [x] Model core domain entities (users, roles, accounts, transactions, budgets, goals, bills, reminders, notifications, AI interactions) and produce an ERD aligning with proposal requirements. (note: docs/domain-model.md outlines entities, attributes, and relationships for ERD handoff.)
- [x] Define API contracts (REST/GraphQL) for each service including request/response schemas and validation rules. (note: docs/api-contracts.md documents REST endpoints, payload examples, and Zod validation schemas for each service plus gateway aggregations.)
- [x] Establish non-functional requirements checklist (performance SLAs, security controls, accessibility targets, analytics, observability) aligned with PDF. (note: docs/non-functional-requirements.md captures checklist and success metrics.)

Developer Tooling & Workflow
- [x] Replace scaffold defaults with project conventions (ESLint/Prettier config, lint-staged, commit hooks). (note: Added hardened ESLint flat config with security/a11y/import rules, project Prettier setup, lint-staged pipeline, and Husky pre-commit running lint-staged plus optional gitleaks scan.)
- [x] Introduce TypeScript path aliases and module boundaries for feature grouping. (note: Added @components/@features/@lib aliases, extracted dashboard sections into feature modules, and centralized navigation types for clear boundaries.)
- [x] Configure environment variable management and secrets handling for local/staging/prod. (note: Added zod-backed env loaders, env:check script, and .env.*.example templates to document secrets across environments.)
- [x] Add Husky or equivalent CI guards plus workspace scripts for lint, type-check, test, build. (note: Added npm CI scripts with vitest harness and Husky pre-push to run lint/typecheck/test/build pipeline.)

Frontend Application Shell
- [x] Remove create-next-app placeholder and port example/index.html layout into reusable Next.js components (sidebar, top bar, cards) with TypeScript. (note: Rebuilt the landing and dashboard shell using typed React components, reused the design tokens from example CSS, and wired interactive state for sidebar navigation, login preview flow, and random tips.)
- [x] Translate example/index.css styles into CSS Modules/System; ensure theme tokens map to light/dark palette described in UX section. (note: replaced global dashboard.css with tokenized CSS modules, added shared patterns/controls, and wired theme variables for light/dark defaults.)
- [x] Implement responsive grid and collapsible sidebar behavior per UX requirements. (note: Added responsive grid breakpoints, a mobile sidebar toggle with overlay close handling, and updated the top bar so navigation collapses gracefully.)
- [x] Build navigation routing structure (landing, auth, dashboard, transactions, budgets, goals, bills, savings, insights, settings, admin). (note: Added app/(app) App Router group with shared dashboard shell, route-aware sidebar, and stub pages for every section.)
- [x] Wire up dark mode toggle with persisted preference (local storage + server default). (note: Enabled ThemeProvider persistence via local storage + cookie, added DOM sync to avoid flash, and introduced tests to cover toggle behavior.)

Frontend Feature Work

(note: Delivered interactive transactions workspace with manual entry flow, dynamic filtering/sorting, selection-based bulk tagging modal, CSV import queue simulation, and Vitest coverage in src/features/transactions.)
- [x] Budgets module: budget creation/editing modal, progress charts, variance alerts, end-of-month summary. (note: Delivered interactive budgets workspace with creation/edit modal, progress chart comparisons, automated variance alerts, and forecasting summary per proposal.)
- [x] Bills & subscriptions: schedule view, upcoming reminders list, payment status toggles. (note: Replaced the placeholder with an interactive Bills workspace featuring grouped schedule views, upcoming reminder timeline, and payment toggles backed by tests.)
- [x] Financial goals: goal builder wizard, progress visualization, AI improve plan prompts. (note: Delivered Goals workspace UI with creation wizard, projections, AI assistant flow, and Vitest coverage in src/features/goals.)
- [x] Insights/AI assistant: conversational UI, recommended actions feed, user feedback logging. (note: Implemented Insights workspace with conversational UI, AI fixtures, recommendation controls, and feedback capture replacing the placeholder.)
- [x] Savings automation setup: rule builder forms (fixed, percentage, round-up). (note: implemented interactive savings automation workspace with rule list, type-specific form, projections, and vitest coverage in src/features/savings.)
- [x] Reports & exports: export modal with CSV/PDF/Excel options, shareable link flow. (note: Added reports workspace with export queue UI, sharing modal, API fixtures, navigation, and tests.)
- [x] Settings pages: profile management, account linking, notification preferences, security controls, account deletion confirmation. (note: Delivered interactive profile form with persisted feedback, institution linking/sync management UI, granular notification toggles, security switches with session controls, and deletion guard rail matching architecture/docs guidance.)
- [x] Dashboard customization: drag-and-drop widget layout with persistence per user. (note: Added dnd-kit sortable layout with saved preferences, customization UI, and test coverage.)
