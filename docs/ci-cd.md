**Overview**

- Platform: GitHub Actions with separate workflows for main CI/CD, PR checks, and security maintenance.
- Scope: Monorepo (Next.js frontend + Auth service) with shared scripts and coverage reporting.
- Goals: Fast feedback on changes, consistent quality gates, and safe, gated deployments.

**Triggers**

- Push: `main`, `develop` branches (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Pull Request: Targeting `main` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`).
- Schedule: Weekly security and dependency scans (`.github/workflows/security.yml`).
- Manual: `workflow_dispatch` for security jobs.

**Pipeline Stages (CI/CD Pipeline)**

- Lint & Type Check: Runs ESLint and TypeScript checks; non-blocking in early setup.
- Frontend Tests: Runs unit tests; uploads coverage to Codecov.
- Auth Service Tests: Runs service tests; uploads coverage to Codecov.
- Build: Builds the application; uploads build artifacts for reuse (7‑day retention).
- Security Scan: Trivy filesystem scan; results uploaded to the Security tab (SARIF).
- Deploy Staging: Gated on `main` and successful build/tests; placeholder for real deploy commands.
- Notify Success: Prints consolidated status when all required jobs succeed.

**PR Checks**

- Validates lint, type check, tests, and a build check on PRs targeting `main`.
- Comments results on the PR for quick visibility (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`).

**Security & Maintenance**

- Dependency Review: Blocks risky dependency updates at PR time based on severity and licenses.
- NPM Audit: Runs weekly; reports moderate+ vulnerabilities.
- CodeQL: Static analysis for JavaScript with results in the Security tab.
- Optional Local Secrets Scan: Husky runs `gitleaks` if present.

**Artifacts & Coverage**

- Artifacts: Next.js `.next/` and `services/auth/dist/` uploaded from CI builds (retained 7 days).
- Coverage: Codecov uploads for frontend and auth service; flags separate coverage sets.

**Environments & Secrets**

- Environments: `staging` environment used for gated deploy step.
- Secrets: GitHub Secrets for tokens/keys (e.g., `CODECOV_TOKEN`, Azure keys when added).
- Env Files: `.env.example`, `.env.staging.example`, `.env.production.example` illustrate required variables.

**Performance Optimizations**

- Node Caching: `actions/setup-node` caches npm dependencies for faster runs.
- Parallelization: Lint/Typecheck, Tests, Security run in parallel; Build depends on quality gates.

**Local Dev Guardrails**

- Husky Pre-commit: Runs `lint-staged` and optional `gitleaks`.
- Husky Pre-push: Encourages `ci:verify` in CI; local pushes skip full verify to avoid blocking flow.
- Scripts: `ci:lint`, `ci:typecheck`, `ci:test`, `ci:build`, `ci:verify` mirror CI commands.

**Files of Record**

- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- PR Checks: `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`
- Security & Maintenance: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- Project Scripts: `package.json`

**Future Enhancements**

- Replace staging placeholder with real deploy (e.g., ECS, Vercel, or container registry + orchestrator) and add smoke tests.
- Add protected environments with required reviewers for production.
- Tighten gates: make lint/typecheck hard‑fail once the codebase stabilizes.
- Improve PR status comment to reference step IDs for accurate outcomes.
- Add test matrix (Node versions, OS) if needed.
